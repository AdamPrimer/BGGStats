## Explanation of Score: ##

1. Look at the votes for the Top 500 games on BGG
2. Rank each user's votes for these games (1 is highest).
3. For each user that has the game "Twilight Struggle" no lower than rank 3 see what other games that user has ranked at least as high.
4. Count how many users have each other game that meet this criterion
5. Divide the number of votes by the total number of people that like the game

## Interpretation of Score: ##

The percentage of people that like the recommended game, that also like Twilight Struggle.

## Sorting: ##

The top 37 games when sorted by `score` are re-sorted by `log(votes) * score`, then the top 25 of those are presented.

This works to rank games with more votes higher, without having really popular games dominate the rankings.
